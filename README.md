# Matrix Project

This project is designed to create an interactive 5x5 letter matrix using HTML and CSS. Users can input letters into each cell of the matrix, making it suitable for various applications such as games, puzzles, or educational tools.

## Project Structure

- **css/styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the HTML table cells, ensuring that each cell stands out with distinct styling such as background color, border, and hover effects.
- **matrix-1.html**: The main HTML file that includes the structure for the 5x5 letter matrix, featuring input fields for user interaction. This file links to the `styles.css` file for styling.

## How to Use

1. Open the `matrix-1.html` file in a web browser.
2. You will see a 5x5 grid of input fields.
3. Click on any cell to enter a letter. Each cell allows only one character due to the `maxlength` attribute set to 1.
4. The styling applied from `styles.css` will enhance the visual appearance of the matrix, making it more engaging.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement JavaScript functionality to validate inputs or provide feedback.
- Add features to save or export the matrix data.
- Enhance the styling for better user experience and accessibility.
